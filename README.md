EasyApply- App for who is seeking a Job in the easiest way!

I´ve recently  finished my bachelor's in Data Science and am now seeking my first job or internship opportunity.
It's very challenging because the market is highly competitive, with hundreds of submissions for every position. I find myself spending a lot of time searching for opportunities, and I wondered: Is it possible to automate that first part of finding jobs?

So, I built this app.

This app helps me by automatically gathering job offers from websites like LinkedIn and Indeed based on the criteria I set. It streamlines the process, saving me time and effort in the initial search.
