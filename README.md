# EasyApply
EasyApply- App for who is seeking a Job in the easiest way!

I´ve recently  finished my bachelor's in Data Science and am now seeking my first job or internship opportunity.
It's very challenging because the market is highly competitive, with hundreds of submissions for every position. I find myself spending a lot of time searching for opportunities, and I wondered: Is it possible to automate that first part of finding jobs?

So, I´m building this app.

💼 What is "Easy Apply 0.1?"  
"Easy Apply" is a feature on LinkedIn that allows job seekers to apply to job postings quickly and directly within LinkedIn, without needing to be redirected to an external company website or fill out long application forms.

✅ Key Characteristics
Simplified Process

You usually just need to upload your CV/resumé, add contact details, and answer a few quick questions (if any).

Many times, it's a 1-click application, especially if your LinkedIn profile is complete and you’ve already uploaded your CV.

Stays Inside LinkedIn

Everything happens within LinkedIn’s interface—no external redirects.

You often apply through a LinkedIn pop-up window (modal).

Company Opt-In

Not all job postings have this option. Only companies that enable Easy Apply on their postings offer it.

📋 Common Form Fields
Depending on the company, you might be asked for:

Your email and phone number

Upload or select your CV/resumé

Answer a few optional or required questions (e.g., “Are you authorized to work in X country?”)

Sometimes you’ll see multiple steps (e.g., profile questions, additional file uploads)

🧠 Best Practices
Keep your LinkedIn profile updated: Since employers may use your profile info as part of the application.

Have a polished CV ready to upload at any time.

Use a tailored cover letter: Some "Easy Apply" forms allow you to upload one.

Track your applications: Because Easy Apply doesn’t always send confirmation emails.

⚠️ Limitations / Downsides
Not always detailed: Some companies want more detailed info than Easy Apply allows.

You’re one of many: It’s easy for hundreds of people to apply—less personalized applications may get overlooked.

No automatic tracking: Unless you use tools or scripts, you have to track responses yourself.

🔧 Automating Easy Apply
If you're building or using automation (as you're doing), here's what usually happens technically:

Click the Easy Apply button

A modal opens

The script:

Fills in text inputs (name, email, phone)

Uploads a resume if needed

Scrolls if needed (to reveal "Next" or "Submit")

Clicks through steps

May stop before final submission (for review)
